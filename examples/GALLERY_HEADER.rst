Welcome to the kgfoundry examples gallery
=========================================

The snippets below are lightweight, CPU-only demonstrations that mirror the
APIs documented elsewhere in the site. They never execute during the Sphinx
build; execution happens separately under the doctest smoke stage so these
pages render quickly while remaining trustworthy.  Use the download buttons to
pull the ``.py`` or ``.ipynb`` versions and adapt them to your needs.

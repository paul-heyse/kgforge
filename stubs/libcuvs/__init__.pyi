"""Type stubs for libcuvs library.

libcuvs provides CUDA-accelerated vector search operations used by FAISS
when GPU support is enabled. This stub module provides minimal type hints
for the library loading function.

    """Load the libcuvs shared library.

    This function loads the CUDA-accelerated vector search library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : object
        Variable positional arguments (unused).
    **kwargs : object
        Variable keyword arguments (unused).

    Notes
    -----
    - Safe to call multiple times (idempotent)
    - Raises ImportError if libcuvs is not available
    - Typically called before importing faiss in GPU-enabled code paths

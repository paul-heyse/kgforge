# Diagrams

Folder-level D2 diagrams will be generated during the MkDocs build. After
running the suite, this section will list the available diagrams with links to
the rendered SVG assets.

Each generated diagram groups modules by their top-level package (for example,
`kgfoundry_common` or `search_api`). Set the `MKDOCS_D2_GROUP_DEPTH`
environment variable during the build to expand the grouping to the desired
dotted-path prefix depth.
